    <!--Simple Discription of the dish and full time to make dish-->
    <p><em>Pizza Pasta</em> is a dish that is just cooked pasta mixed with pizza ingredients. This dish is just a fun way to enjoy the pizza flovor but in pasta form. It is also cheaper to make and can serve many poeple. I usually make this dish when I have family over, or when my daughter wants some pasta. We all love the fun rotini pasta and the fact that we always have left overs for lunch the next day.</p>
